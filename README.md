# Getting Started
The fastest way to use this as a boilerplate:

```
// Get the latest version
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Munsterberg/gemstone myAppName

// cd myAppName
cd myAppName

// Install dependencies
npm install

node app.js
```

This project was heavily influenced by the [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)

I also recommend installing nodemon globally in order to run node.js applications. It is a file watcher and restarts your app automatically.

Simply 

```
npm install nodemon -g

nodemon app.js
```

## What is this?

This is a node.js application boilerplate that I use for my simple projects that require a quick setup. It follows MVC techniques and allows users to quickly start building node apps. If you have any questions please email me at jake@oshawadesign.com. I created primarily for myself, so you will see changes quite often depending on my personal preferences, e.g. view engine changes.
